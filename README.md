# Maze generator with P5

![](./images/dfs_circle.png)

Maze generator algorithms with visualization using p5js.

The implemented algorithms are:

* Depth-first search
* Prim
* Kruskal

`sketch_circle.js` is an example of a maze generation with DFS using a rule to form a circle, `sketch_circle_iteration.js` is the equivalent example with per-iteration visualization.
